📊 Project Overview - 
This project focuses on analyzing Netflix's dataset to reveal patterns and trends in its content library. It examines key aspects such as the distribution of content by type, the popularity of various genres, trends in ratings, and the geographical distribution of content production. The analysis leverages Python libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizations, SQL for querying, and Power BI for creating interactive dashboards. These tools collectively help transform raw data into meaningful insights, enabling Netflix to better understand its audience and content trends.

🚀 Key Objectives - 
The primary goal of this project is to gain a deeper understanding of Netflix’s content landscape. By analyzing the data, this project explores the distribution of content by type, such as movies versus TV shows. It identifies the top-performing genres and examines trends over time. Additionally, the project analyzes the distribution of ratings across the platform and highlights contributions from different countries. Content duration for both movies and TV shows is also explored, along with year-wise trends in content additions. These objectives aim to uncover critical insights to support Netflix’s content strategy.

🛠️ Technologies Used - 
The analysis employs a combination of programming and visualization tools to achieve its objectives. Python is used extensively for data processing, cleaning, and exploratory analysis. Pandas, a powerful Python library, is used for manipulating the data, while Matplotlib and Seaborn generate compelling visualizations of trends and patterns. SQL is utilized for querying the dataset and extracting specific insights. Finally, Power BI is used to create dynamic and interactive dashboards, which allow stakeholders to explore the insights visually and interactively.

📂 Dataset - 
The dataset used in this project, titled "Netflix Titles Dataset," was sourced from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows). It is provided in CSV format and contains metadata for Netflix’s content, including information such as type (Movie or TV Show), title, release year, duration, rating, country of production, and listed genres. This dataset forms the foundation for the analysis and is critical in revealing patterns and trends within Netflix’s extensive library.

📈 Key Insights - 
The analysis uncovered several important insights about Netflix’s content. First, it revealed a clear distinction in the distribution of content types, showing how movies and TV shows are represented on the platform. The analysis also identified the top ten most popular genres on Netflix, providing valuable insights into audience preferences. The geographical exploration highlighted the top ten countries that contribute the most content, shedding light on Netflix’s global content strategy. Furthermore, the distribution of content ratings was analyzed, revealing the frequency of different ratings and their impact on audience demographics. Lastly, the year-wise trends in content additions were visualized, illustrating how Netflix has scaled its library over time and responded to audience demand.

Through this analysis, the project provides a comprehensive view of Netflix’s content library, enabling the platform to leverage data-driven insights for strategic decision-making.
